## About this script
If you have a server that not has enough RAM, crashes frequently and you don't have the budget for an upgrade. This script can help you! You can set a limit RAM usage value. If the value is reached, the script automatically clears the RAM cache in order to avoid a crash. Also it's possible to configure the Swap memory via Swappiness to alleviate the RAM memory if it reaches a certain value. 

## Commands
```
stop-auto, to stop
start-auto, to start when stopped
rm-auto, to remove the script
```
